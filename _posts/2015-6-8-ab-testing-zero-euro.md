title: A / B Testing zero euro
---

If you're googling around looking for A/B testing tools, you will fall on every possible commercial tool excerpt... the one of google, which is actually free.

A / B testing is already included in Google Analytics.

For the tutorial crazyegg published a [very detailed post] a few days ago that really worth reading.

Pros:

* It doesn't not just split the traffic, it enforce the user to associate a test
* Very wide possibilities about what to test,
* It is able of automatically increase traffic on the version that works better,
* It automagically knows when the test is enoughly statistically significant, so that there is a clear winner at the end.

Cons:

* Kind of fragility to integrate properly the tool since it involve copy/pasting code, know if the test or GA is actually working can be tricky.


Lessons Learned:

* Free tools are rarely highlighted, because of commercial pressure, which is normal.
* Free tools are more than enough for a young startup.
